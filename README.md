# My Leadership Readme / User Manual
This "user manual" is intended to help others understand how to best work with me. I'm very happy to discuss this in person at any time.

## My Leadership Traits
### Birkman
* Interests: As a **Blue**, I'm a *thinker*. I like to create, discover new ways to solve problems, plan how to do things, and consider the future. I also like time for reflection. 
* Usual Behavior: As a **Green**, I'm a natural *communicator*. Alignment is important to me. I collaborate, help, teach, and advocate for people.  
* Needs/Stress Behavior: As a **Blue**, when I am stressed I can be indecisive and fatigued. I can become self-critical, idealistic, and impractical. When I am in this state, what I need is time to make complex decisions. I need time alone or with one or two others. I also respond well to people encourage trust and fairness, don't interrupt me unnecessarily, and invite my input.

### Gallup StrengthsFinder
* **Individualization** one who draws upon the uniqueness of individuals to create successful teams
* **Activator** one who acts to start things in motion
* **Achiever** one with a constant drive for accomplishing tasks
* **Restorative** one who thrives on solving difficult problems
* **Harmony** one who seeks to avoid conflict and achieve success through consensus

### Enneagram
* **1 (Reformer)**  The Rational, Idealistic Type: Principled, Purposeful, Self-Controlled, and Perfectionistic
* **Wing 2 (Helper)** The Caring, Interpersonal Type: Demonstrative, Generous, People-Pleasing, and Possessive

## My Focus 
My focus is execution while adhering to the team's core values. Through this lens, I concentrate on:
* Technical execution through people development, process, and technical investments
* Team Alignment
* Connecting the dots from tech to business

## My Working Style
### Working Availability
As a working parent, I have a strict schedule for childcare responsibilities, and I balance this by working early in the mornings and late in the evenings. Furthermore, I am generally flexible and willing to making changes to my schedule on a case-by-case basis, as long as I have time to arrange backup childcare. A 24-hour advance notice is preferable.

### Meetings
#### Booking Time with Me
I always keep my calendar availability up to date. If there is a conflict with my calender, please ping me and I will work with you on how to resolve it.

#### 1:1s
I do weekly 1:1s with my direct reports, and if you're a manager, you can expect "skip level" 1:1s where I'll chat with your direct reports. Our 1:1 conversations will be driven by my focus areas mentioned above, which can cover your challenges, goals, priorities, and what you need to be suppported and leverage your strengths.

#### Collaborating in Meetings

### Communication
#### Preferred Modes of Communication 
Generally, I am flexible with various modes of communication. I've worked at companies that were very Slack-heavy, and others that were email-heavy. I can adapt to whatever works best for the team. That said, generally my preference is to use Slack (or whatever chat application is used by the team) for time-sensitive communication, and email for any communication that requires deeper thinking and evaluation. I appreciate being given expected timelines for responses, and I will do the same.

#### Giving and Receiving Feedback
