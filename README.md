# Hi, I'm Amy
Generally speaking, I prefer to have a face-to-face conversation about the "readme" of my working style, but since we all have our own communication and learning preferences, I thought a written version might be useful to some folks. I'm very happy to discuss my "readme" in further detail at any time.

## My Personal Guiding Principles

### My Top Strengths

### My Philosophies on Team Building

## The Logistics

### One-on-Ones

### Meeting Protocol
