# My Leadership Readme / User Manual
This "user manual" is intended to help others understand how to best work with me. I'm very happy to discuss this in person at any time.

## My Style
### Gallup StrengthsFinder
* **Individualization** (one who draws upon the uniqueness of individuals to create successful teams)
* **Activator** (one who acts to start things in motion)
* **Achiever** (one with a constant drive for accomplishing tasks)
* **Restorative** (one who thrives on solving difficult problems)
* **Harmony** (one who seeks to avoid conflict and achieve success through consensus)

I am most excited about Individualization because I've been able to leverage this to successfully build happy and productive teams, but all of these themes contribute to my philosophies on team building (see below).

### Birkman
* Interests: Blue
* Usual Behavior: Green
* Needs/Stress Behavior: Blue

### Enneagram
