# Hi, I'm Amy
Generally speaking, I prefer to have a face-to-face conversation about the "readme" of my working style, but since we all have our own communication and learning preferences, I thought a written version might be useful to some folks. I'm very happy to discuss my "readme" in further detail at any time.

## My Personal Guiding Principles
I've worked at multiple tech companies as an engineering leader over the past 10 years, and even though the company cultures and expectations have varied, my personal guiding principles have remained the same.

### My "Top Strengths"
According to [Gallup's Clifton StrengthsFinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Now,_Discover_Your_Strengths), here are my top "strengths" (or "talent themes" according to Gallup).
1. **Individualization** (one who draws upon the uniqueness of individuals to create successful teams)
2. **Activator** (one who acts to start things in motion)
3. **Achiever** (one with a constant drive for accomplishing tasks)
4. **Restorative** (one who thrives on solving difficult problems)
5. **Harmony** (one who seeks to avoid conflict and achieve success through consensus)

I am most excited about Individualization because I've been able to leverage this to successfully build happy and productive teams, but all of these themes contribute to my philosophies on team building (see below).

### My Philosophies on Team Building
1. Build a team like an orchestra. There is no single rockstar. (Individualization, Harmony)
2. A team is a system of people, which also needs to scale and integrate with other "systems". (Individualization, Activator, Harmony)
3. Own it. To build trust, own your mistakes, then own fixing them. (Restorative, Achiever)
