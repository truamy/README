# My Leadership Readme / User Manual
This "user manual" is intended to help others understand how to best work with me. I'm very happy to discuss this in person at any time.

## My Leadership Traits
### Birkman Colors
* **Interests**: As a **Blue**, I'm a *thinker*. I like to create, discover new ways to solve problems, plan how to do things, and consider the future. I also like time for reflection. 
* **Usual Behavior**: As a **Green**, I'm a natural *communicator*. Alignment is important to me. I collaborate, help, teach, and advocate for people.  
* **Needs/Stress Behavior**: As a **Blue**, when I am stressed I can be indecisive and fatigued. I can become self-critical, idealistic, and impractical. When I am in this state, what I need is time to make complex decisions. I need time alone or with one or two others. I also respond well to people who encourage trust and fairness, don't interrupt me unnecessarily, and invite my input.

## My Working Style
### Working Availability
As a working parent, I have a strict schedule for childcare responsibilities, and I balance this by working early in the mornings and late in the evenings. That said, I am generally flexible and willing to making changes to my schedule on a case-by-case basis, as long as I have time to arrange backup childcare. A 24-hour advance notice is preferable and appreciated.

### Meeting Logistics
* **Booking Time with Me**: I always keep my calendar availability up to date. If there is a conflict with my calender, please ping me and I will work with you on how to resolve it.
* **1:1s**: I do weekly 1:1s with my direct reports, and if you're a manager, you can expect "skip level" 1:1s (at a different cadence) where I'll chat with your direct reports. Our 1:1 conversations will be driven by our business focus areas, which can cover your challenges, goals, priorities, and what you need to be suppported and to leverage your individual strengths.

### Communication
* **Preferred Modes of Communication**: Generally, I am flexible with various modes of communication. I've worked at companies that were very Slack-heavy, and others that were email-heavy. I can adapt to whatever works best for the team. That said, generally my preference is to use Slack (or whatever chat application is used by the team) for time-sensitive communication, and email for any communication that requires deeper thinking and evaluation. I appreciate being given expected timelines for responses, and I will do the same.
* **Collaborating in Meetings**: I don't like to react in a meeting, or make fast important decisions in a meeting. I usually like to think it through. I appreciate when meeting materials, or even high-level context, are given to me in advance to allow me to independently process the information and mentally prepare for the discussion. This will support me to perform at my best, and allow me to effectively collaborate and make the right decisions for the team.
