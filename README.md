# My Leadership Readme / User Manual
This "user manual" is intended to help others understand how to best work with me. I'm very happy to discuss this in person at any time.

## My Leadership Traits
### Birkman Colors
* **Interests**: As a **Blue**, I'm a *thinker*. I like to create, discover new ways to solve problems, plan how to do things, and consider the future. I also like time for reflection. 
* **Usual Behavior**: As a **Green**, I'm a natural *communicator*. Alignment is important to me. I collaborate, help, teach, and advocate for people.  
* **Needs/Stress Behavior**: As a **Blue**, when I am stressed I can be indecisive and fatigued. I can become self-critical, idealistic, and impractical. When I am in this state, what I need is time to make complex decisions. I need time alone or with one or two others. I also respond well to people who encourage trust and fairness, don't interrupt me unnecessarily, and invite my input.

### Gallup StrengthsFinder
* **Individualization**: I like to draw upon the uniqueness of individuals to create successful teams.
* **Activator**: I tend to act to start things in motion.
* **Achiever**: I have a constant drive for accomplishing tasks.
* **Restorative**: I thrive on solving difficult problems.
* **Harmony**: I look for areas of common ground in order to build strong relationships.

### Enneagram
* **1 (Reformer)**  The Rational, Idealistic Type: Principled, Purposeful, Self-Controlled, and Perfectionistic
  * With a **Wing 2 (Helper)** The Caring, Interpersonal Type: Demonstrative, Generous, People-Pleasing, and Possessive

## My Focus
My focus is execution on the company vision while adhering to the team's core values. Through this lens, I concentrate on:
* Technical execution through people development, process, and technical investments
* Team Alignment
* Connecting the dots from tech to business

## My Working Style
### Working Availability
As a working parent, I have a strict schedule for childcare responsibilities, and I balance this by working early in the mornings and late in the evenings. Furthermore, I am generally flexible and willing to making changes to my schedule on a case-by-case basis, as long as I have time to arrange backup childcare. A 24-hour advance notice is preferable and appreciated.

### Meeting Logistics
* **Booking Time with Me**: I always keep my calendar availability up to date. If there is a conflict with my calender, please ping me and I will work with you on how to resolve it.
* **1:1s**: I do weekly 1:1s with my direct reports, and if you're a manager, you can expect "skip level" 1:1s (at a different cadence) where I'll chat with your direct reports. Our 1:1 conversations will be driven by my focus areas mentioned above, which can cover your challenges, goals, priorities, and what you need to be suppported and to leverage your individual strengths.

### Communication
* **Preferred Modes of Communication**: Generally, I am flexible with various modes of communication. I've worked at companies that were very Slack-heavy, and others that were email-heavy. I can adapt to whatever works best for the team. That said, generally my preference is to use Slack (or whatever chat application is used by the team) for time-sensitive communication, and email for any communication that requires deeper thinking and evaluation. I appreciate being given expected timelines for responses, and I will do the same.
* **Collaborating in Meetings**: I don't like to react in a meeting, or make fast important decisions in a meeting. I usually like to think it through. I appreciate when meeting materials, or even high-level context, are given to me in advance to allow me to independently process the information and mentally prepare for the discussion. This will support me to perform at my best, and allow me to effectively collaborate and make the right decisions for the team.

#### Giving and Receiving Feedback
* **Giving**: For us to make a meaningful impact as a team, we need to continue to learn and grow, and we can't do that without regular feedback. Therefore, if any feedback comes as a major surprise, that is usually an indication to me that I have not done my job as a leader. I try to nip things in the bud when I can, and I aim for providing *course corrections* (vs major surprise feedback) to keep every individual focused and on track to successfully achieve their goals. Furthermore, it's also important to deliver feedback in a respectful way. Constructive feedback is always done privately and with kindness and empathy for the person receiving the feedback.
* **Receiving**: I like to receive feedback the same way I prefer to give it. The sooner, the better (and with respect).
